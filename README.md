<h1>This repository contains a script written in JavaScript that will say the prime numbers from 1 to the number you want</h1>

<p>
In math, prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1, that have only two factors â€“ 1 and the number itself.
Prime numbers are divisible only by the number 1 or itself.  
 
For example, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 are the first few prime numbers.</p>

This script allows you to input a number and it will give you all the prime numbers between 1 and the number chosen by you and it will also tell you which is the biggest among them.</p>
